            <div class="higher">Fun Fact: </u><br><br>Invader records all the pieces he makes including the date and location, awarding each artwork a score between 10 and 100 depending on the success of the ‘invasion’. Each city earns its own ranking by adding all the scores together. Invader estimates that up 15 per cent of his early works have now been removed. As a result he now places many of his pieces out of easy reach.</div>
